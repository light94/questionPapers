This repository is a set of python scripts that downloads ***ALL*** question  papers from **IIT KGP**'s server. It organizes the paper into directories and subdirectories, naming them with the correct year and name of semester, making it easy to find any paper.


The 2 scripts are:
* fetchpapers.py
* fetchpapers2.py

The first script will download all question papers of all departments for years **upto 2007**.

The second script will download all question papers of all phases (autumn,spring) for **years > 2007**

Ofcourse, this is _not meant to be run by every person_. I intend to upload all these files on a new server from which people can download their stuff.

Some department question papers failed to download, possibly due to encoding error.

You can contribute to this project by forking it and sending me a pull request.
