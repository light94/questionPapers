It's that time of year again when the institute server will crash on account of more than 10,000 students downloading previous year question papers.

***Not any more***. 
This repo has 2 scripts:
1)fetchpapers.py
2)fetchpapers.py

The first script will download all question papers of all departments for years upto 2007.

The second script will download all question papers of all phases (autumn,spring) for years > 2007

Ofcourse, this is not meant to be run by every user. I intend to upload all these files on a new server from which people can download their stuff.

Some department question papers failed to download, possibly due to encoding error. I shall be updating it soon.
