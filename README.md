This repository is a set of python scripts that downloads ***ALL*** question  papers from the institute's server. It makes neat directories and subdirectories, naming them with the correct year and name of semester, making it easy to find any paper.


The 2 scripts are:
1)fetchpapers.py
2)fetchpapers2.py

The first script will download all question papers of all departments for years upto 2007.

The second script will download all question papers of all phases (autumn,spring) for years > 2007

Ofcourse, this is not meant to be run by every user. I intend to upload all these files on a new server from which people can download their stuff.

Some department question papers failed to download, possibly due to encoding error. I shall be updating it soon.
